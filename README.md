WebScPr - Web-Script Programming
======

###About
This repository contains the coursework produced as part of my 2013/14 web-scripting unit, part of year 2 BSc Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth. 

This was a first experience with many of the languages involved, and as such there is plenty of room for improvement!

###The Task
> You are to specify and construct HTML and PHP web-pages that support an easily-updated and customized "online shopping" capability for selling whatever kind of physical product your client wishes.

This would be accomplished through standard JS, PHP, HTML, CSS and nothing more - no frameworks or libraries.
